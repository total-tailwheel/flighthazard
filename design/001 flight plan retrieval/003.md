**Title:** Integrate API endpoints for airport and flight plan data retrieval

**Story:**
Developers and users of the Flight Hazard app currently rely on hardcoded data for airports and flight plans within the app. This limits the flexibility and scalability of the app as changes to the data require an update to the app code and redeployment. By fetching data from a backend via `/api/airports` and `/api/flight-plans`, the app will dynamically display current information, improving user experience and making the management of data more efficient. This integration is crucial for pilots and travelers who need access to the most updated and accurate flight information.

**Changes:**
1. **Flight Hazard/Flight Hazard/FlightDataService.swift**: Refactor `getAirports` and `getFlightPlans` methods to perform HTTP GET requests to the backend endpoints `/api/airports` and `/api/flight-plans` respectively.
2. **Flight Hazard/Flight Hazard/FlightDataService.swift**: Implement error handling for the HTTP requests to manage scenarios where the data fetch may fail.
3. **Flight Hazard/Flight Hazard/FlightDataService.swift**: Parse the JSON responses from these endpoints and convert them to the appropriate Swift structures.
4. **Flight Hazard/Flight HazardTests/Flight_HazardTests.swift**: Update unit tests to mock the backend responses for the new API endpoints ensuring the app handles both success and failure scenarios appropriately.

**Context:**
- **Code snippet from FlightDataService.swift**:
  ```swift
  // Existing hardcoded data method
  static func getAirports() -> [String] {
      return ["Airport 1", "Airport 2", "Airport 3"]
  }

  static func getFlightPlans() -> [FlightPlan] {
      return [
          FlightPlan(start: "Airport 1", end: "Airport 2", date: "2024-05-04"),
          FlightPlan(start: "Airport 2", end: "Airport 3", date: "2024-05-05")
      ]
  }
  ```
- These methods are called from `ContentView.swift` which implies that any changes to these methods should not disrupt the appâ€™s user interface which lists these data points.

By aligning the internal app structure with external data sources, the Flight Hazard app positions itself for more robust functionality and easier data management, streamlining updates and data accuracy for its users.
