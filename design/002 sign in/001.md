To implement user login in your iOS app using Apple credentials, you can use the **Sign in with Apple** feature. This requires setting up the feature in both your Apple Developer account and your iOS project. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

### 1. Configure Sign in with Apple in Developer Account
First, ensure you've enabled **Sign in with Apple** in your Apple Developer account:
- Go to the [Apple Developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/).
- Navigate to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles.
- Select Identifiers, and ensure your app's identifier enables **Sign in with Apple**.

### 2. Update Xcode Project
In your Xcode project, make sure to enable **Sign in with Apple** in the Capabilities tab:
```plaintext
1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Select your app target.
3. Go to the Signing & Capabilities tab.
4. Add the “Sign in with Apple” capability.
```

### 3. Implement Sign in with Apple
Here’s how you can implement the feature in your iOS app using Swift:

```swift
import AuthenticationServices

class SignInWithAppleManager: NSObject, ASAuthorizationControllerDelegate {

    // Prepare a request for Apple ID authorization
    func startSignInWithAppleFlow() {
        let provider = ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider()
        let request = provider.createRequest()
        request.requestedScopes = [.fullName, .email]
        
        let authorizationController = ASAuthorizationController(authorizationRequests: [request])
        authorizationController.delegate = self
        authorizationController.performRequests()
    }

    // Handle authorization success
    func authorizationController(controller: ASAuthorizationController, didCompleteWithAuthorization authorization: ASAuthorization) {
        if let appleIDCredential = authorization.credential as? ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential {
            // Retrieve the user identity and other user info here
            let userId = appleIDCredential.user
            let userFirstName = appleIDCredential.fullName?.givenName
            let userEmail = appleIDCredential.email
            // Proceed with signing the user in using the retrieved credentials
        }
    }

    // Handle authorization failure
    func authorizationController(controller: ASAuthorizationController, didCompleteWithError error: Error) {
        // Handle error
        print("Sign in with Apple Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}

```

### 4. Trigger Sign in with Apple
To trigger the sign-in process, you typically add a sign-in button to your UI:

```swift
import AuthenticationServices

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        setupSignInAppleButton()
    }

    private func setupSignInAppleButton() {
        let signInButton = ASAuthorizationAppleIDButton()
        signInButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(handleAuthorizationAppleIDButtonPress), for: .touchUpInside)
        // Add signInButton to your view
        self.view.addSubview(signInButton)
    }

    @objc private func handleAuthorizationAppleIDButtonPress() {
        let signInWithAppleManager = SignInWithAppleManager()
        signInWithAppleManager.startSignInWithAppleFlow()
    }
}
```

### 5. Handle User Credentials
Finally, make sure to securely handle and store the credentials received from Apple, based on your backend and security requirement.

### Note:
- Ensure you follow the guidelines set by Apple, including proper handling of user data.
- Update your Xcode to the latest stable version to support all the new features effectively.

This setup provides a secure and convenient way for users to log into your application using their Apple ID.
