**Title**: Implement data retrieval and rendering for saved airports and flight plans in Swift UI

**Story**: Users need to quickly access their personalized list of saved airports and flight plans upon opening the Flight Hazard app. This feature will enhance user satisfaction by providing a tailored experience, allowing them to efficiently plan and review their flights based on previously stored preferences.

**Changes**:
1. **Flight Hazard/Flight Hazard/Flight_HazardApp.swift**:
   - Modify the `ContentView` call in `WindowGroup` to include initialization with saved airports and flight plans. Fetch this data during app initialization.
   
2. **Flight Hazard/Flight Hazard/ContentView.swift**:
   - Enhance the `ContentView` to accept a list of saved airports and flight plans. Display these details in a user-friendly layout using SwiftUI's List or other suitable components.
   
3. **WeatherService API (External)**:
   - Develop an API endpoint that serves saved airport identifiers and flight plans as JSON. Ensure this endpoint is secure and performs efficiently under load.
   
4. **Flight Hazard/Flight HazardTests/Flight_HazardTests.swift**:
   - Add tests to verify the functionality of fetching and displaying saved airport and flight plan data in `ContentView`.

5. **Backend Integration (new Swift file)**:
   - Create a new Swift file, `DataFetcher.swift`, responsible for making API calls to fetch the user's saved airport and flight plan data. Handle errors and parsing of JSON data.

**Context**:

1. **Flight Hazard/Flight Hazard/Flight_HazardApp.swift**:
```swift
@main
struct Flight_HazardApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```
   - This segment initializes the main UI scene. Modifying this to initialize with user data ensures data is available when the view is rendered.

2. **Flight Hazard/Flight Hazard/ContentView.swift**:
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, world!")
            .padding()
    }
}
```
   - This is the primary view displayed to the user upon app initialization, where saved airports and flight data should be displayed.

3. **Backend API Specification (Required)**:
   - A detailed specification and implementation of the backend API should be generated to ensure the frontend Swift application can correctly retrieve and parse this information, formatted typically in JSON.

By implementing these enhancements, the Flight Hazard app will provide a more immersive and custom-tailored experience to its user base, directly influencing customer satisfaction and app usability.
