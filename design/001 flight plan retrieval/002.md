**Title**: Update ContentView to display lists of Airports and Flight Plans

**Story**: Users of the Flight Hazard iOS app need to view and manage lists of Airports and Flight Plans directly from the ContentView. This will enable users to quickly access and review their travel plans and related airports, enhancing user interaction and making the app more functional and informative.

**Changes**:
1. `Flight Hazard/Flight Hazard/ContentView.swift`:
   - Add a new `List` component for Airports displaying hard-coded list entries.
   - Implement a second `List` for Flight Plans showing the start and end airports, and travel date for each plan.
   - Ensure that both lists are scrollable and styled appropriately for readability and accessibility.

2. `Flight Hazard/Flight Hazard/ContentView.swift`:
   - Define two arrays in the `ContentView` struct, one for Airports and another for Flight Plans, to store the hardcoded data temporarily.
   - Update the preview provider to include these new lists for rendering previews in different states.

**Context**:
1. **Current ContentView Implementation**: 
   ```swift
   // Flight Hazard/Flight Hazard/ContentView.swift
   import SwiftUI

   struct ContentView: View {
       var body: some View {
           Text("Hello, world!")
               .padding()
       }
   }
   ```
   - The `ContentView` currently only displays a static text. This needs to be expanded to include the new lists for functional enhancement.

2. **SwiftUI List Usage**: 
   - Use `List` in SwiftUI to display arrays of data efficiently. This component supports dynamic changes and can be integrated directly within the `ContentView`.

3. **Code Styling and Accessibility**:
   - As the app grows, ensure that the styling remains consistent and that accessibility features such as readable fonts and sufficient contrast are maintained.
